## Hi there, I'm Patrick Loven ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

Technologyâ€‘focused engineering leader with 15+ years of handsâ€‘on fullâ€‘stack development across consumerâ€‘internet, mobile, and enterprise domains. I turn complex business problems into strategic, customerâ€‘centric solutions by coding, architecting, and deploying cloudâ€‘native platforms that scale securely and compliantly.

What I bring to the table

- Fullâ€‘stack development & team building â€“ I write productionâ€‘grade code in Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Java; I also hire, mentor, and coach agile squads (Scrum/Kanban) that consistently ship features faster while boosting engagement scores.
- Cloudâ€‘native architecture & DevOps â€“ Designed and implemented APIâ€‘first microâ€‘service ecosystems on AWS & GCP using Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Vault; set up CI/CD pipelines that deliver multiple releases per day.
- Data integration & realâ€‘time pipelines â€“ Built MDM, ETL, and eventâ€‘driven architectures that synchronize data across FinTech, MarTech, and EdTech platforms, ensuring lowâ€‘latency insight delivery.
- AI/ML & generative tooling â€“ Fineâ€‘tuned large language models (GPTâ€‘3/4) and built Retrievalâ€‘Augmented Generation (RAG) services; engineered endâ€‘toâ€‘end generative AI pipelines (Stable Diffusion, RVC, TorToise) that lifted customer conversion rates and reduced contentâ€‘creation time.
- Compliance, security & reliability â€“ Hardened applications to meet PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, PFI/PII standards; automated security testing and continuous compliance monitoring across all environments.
